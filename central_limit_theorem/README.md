# Central Limit theorem
- the central limit theorem states that the sample mean of a sufficiently large number of random variables is approximately normally distributed. The larger the sample, the better the approximation.
- it allows us to make claims about entire populations, assuming that we have done a good job sampling
- it also describes the characteristics of the population of the means which is created from the means of an infinite number of random population samples of size n, all from a given parent population.

## it predicts:
1. the mean of the populations of means is always equal to the mean of the parent population from which the samples were drawn
2. the standard deviation of the population of means is always equal to the standard deviation of the parent population divided by the square root of the sample size, n.
3. the distribution of means will increasingly approximate a normal distribution as the size n of samples increases

## consequences:
1. if we average the measurements of a particular quantity. the distribution of our averages tends to a normal one.
2. as the number of variables goes up, the total amount of error in the data goes up as well.
