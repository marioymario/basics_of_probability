# Data distributions

Data is described as normal, or normally distributed, if most values cluster in the center of the range, with the rest tapering off symmetrically to the left and the right. The mean and median of a normally distributed variable are equal. The information in a normal distribution can be summarized by the mean μ (mu) and standard deviation σ (sigma)
