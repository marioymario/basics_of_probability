# Data distributions

Data is described as normal, or normally distributed, if most values cluster in the center of the range, 
with the rest tapering off symmetrically to the left and the right. The mean and median of a normally 
distributed variable are equal. 

Visual comparation or QQ test help us understand relashinships and compare distributions.

1. mise en place data set1 and data set2
2. create a test for non normality
3. plot the unkown plot against a normal distribuited and asses the visual relationship
