# Frequentist versus Bayesian

Probability is a way of quantifying the likelihood of a future outcome.

## frequentist
The frequentist school of thought defines probability as describing how often a particular outcome would occur in an experiment if that experiment were repeated over and over.

## Bayesian
The Bayesian school of thought defines probability as describing how likely an observer expects a particular outcome to be in the future, based on previous experience and expert knowledge. Each time the experiment is run, the probability is updated if the new data changes the belief about the likelihood of the outcome. The probability based on previous experiences is called the prior probability, or the prior, while the updated probability based on the newest experiment is called the posterior probability.
